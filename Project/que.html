<a name="question1">Do I need a contract to offer
 food from catering to donate?</a>
It is optional. It never hurts to have everything in writing,
so both parties are clear on what are our responsibilities.
Larger operations in cities will often require proper documantation
and donators to sign in on the website to complete the formality.

<a name="question2">What kind of food and food
 equipment is allowed to donate?</a>
Big Restaurants have advantage over independent caterers,
in that they already have most of the equipments
needed for catering, such as plates, glasses, flatware
and serving utensils. It may be more economical to rent linens,
if you do not normally carry them, or if you do not have enough on hand for
both your regular dining room and your function room will work.

<a name="question3">How much should i pay for my stuff?</a>
There's no need to pay. Since you're donating food there's
no need to pay for anything. However, any dontaion would be welcome.

<a name="question4">Can you help me with rental equipment?</a>
We have a large array of rental options available.
If it so happens that we do not carry a specific rental equipment needed,
we will be sure to put you in contact with
trusted vendors who can meet your specific needs.
In the event any rented goods are damaged,
whether due to actions of the customer or their guests,
the customer will be financially responsible for the replacement.

<a name="question5">How long do I have to wait if no one shows up
 for the leftover food??</a>
First, check your local health codes to find out
if there are any specific rules about leftover food.
Barring any health codes, the choice is up to you.
In general, most caterers will prepare 5%-10% more food than necessary,
as a backup. The customer did not pay for that extra food and
is in no way entitled to it. 
A gesture of goodwill is to give them the food they paid for.
